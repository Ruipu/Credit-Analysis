# 🏦 Financial Data EDA & Credit Risk Analysis Collection

This repository contains a series of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning projects based on real-world financial datasets. The aim is to explore, visualize, and model credit risk, marketing outcomes, and approval decisions in various banking and lending scenarios.

## 📚 Project Overview

This collection includes EDA and modeling notebooks covering:

- **Credit Risk Analysis:** Variable exploration and risk modeling for credit approval.
- **Credit Card Approval Prediction:** Building machine learning models to predict credit card application outcomes.
- **Bank Marketing Analytics:** Customer segmentation and outcome analysis using telemarketing data.
- **P2P LendingClub Loan Analysis:** Borrower profiling, loan product analysis, and default risk exploration.

## 💡 Key Objectives

- **Understand Customer and Borrower Profiles:**  
  Analyze the demographic, financial, and behavioral characteristics of customers and loan applicants.

- **Explore Variable Distributions and Relationships:**  
  Visualize key features such as loan amount, interest rate, income, grade, purpose, and home ownership to understand their impact on outcomes.

- **Reveal Risk Structures and Business Patterns:**  
  Compare approval and default rates across segments (e.g., by credit grade, loan purpose, amount bins).

- **Lay the Foundation for Predictive Modeling:**  
  Support downstream tasks like risk prediction, credit scoring, or marketing targeting through feature engineering and variable selection.

## 📝 Included Notebooks
